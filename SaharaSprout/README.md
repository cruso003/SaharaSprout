# SaharaSprout

## Overview

SaharaSprout is a smart irrigation mobile application designed to empower farmers and agricultural enthusiasts in arid regions, particularly in Africa. By leveraging the Internet of Things (IoT), SaharaSprout enables efficient water management, ultimately improving crop yield and sustainability. The application is tailored to help users monitor soil moisture levels, control irrigation systems remotely, and receive alerts about optimal watering conditions.

## Purpose of the Name

The name "SaharaSprout" encapsulates the essence of the project. "Sahara" symbolizes the dry, arid regions where effective water management is crucial for successful agriculture, while "Sprout" signifies growth and development in farming. Together, they represent a commitment to fostering agricultural progress and resilience in challenging environments.
